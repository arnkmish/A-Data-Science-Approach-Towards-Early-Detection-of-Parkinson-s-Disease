# A-Data-Science-Approach-Towards-Early-Detection-of-Parkinson-s-Disease

This repository explores the problem of early detection of Parkinson's disease using Data Science and Machine Learning ideas, considering numerical speech feature dataset.

Each of he steps involved in a Data Science approach towards solving the problem is explored in this repository, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, class imbalance handling, ML based predictive modeling, and hyperparameter tuning.

For the purpose of experimentation, a publicly avalable dataset consisting of Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient(MFCC) based speech features is considered which is cited below-

Sakar, C., Serbes, Gorkem, Gunduz, Aysegul, Nizam, Hatice & Sakar, Betul. (2018). Parkinson's Disease Classification. UCI Machine Learning Repository. (https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinson+s+disease+classification)

The dataset consists of 756 samples with 754 features each. A total of 564 samples are Parkinson's positive and 192 samples are Parkinson's negative, showing clear imbalance in the class distribution.
